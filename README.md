# A boardgame made with javaFX for my second semester subject: Software development in practice
## The game
## There are 22 red, and 3 blue pieces on the 5x5 sized board. One player moves with red, the other, with blue. The blue player begins the game.
## Every step consists of moving one piece.

1. The red player can only move to a neighbouring field
2. The blue player can only move to a neighbouring field that is already occupied by a red piece. Then, this red piece will be removed.

## The red player wins, if all blue pieces are in one single row or column. The blue player wins, if they cannot move in any direction.
