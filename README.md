# A boardgame made with javaFX for my second semester subject: Software development in practice
## The application
## There are 22 red, and 3 blue pieces on the 5x5 sized controller. One player moves with red, the other, with blue. The blue player begins the application.
## Every step consists of moving one piece.

1. The red player can only move to a neighbouring field
2. The blue player can only move to a neighbouring field that is already occupied by a red piece. Then, this red piece will be removed.

## The red player wins, if all blue pieces are in one single row or column. The blue player wins, if they cannot move in any direction.


## To try out the game, run: demo/BoardGame.exe

At the start of the game, you can set the player names.
