# Red And Blue BoardGame
A boardgame made with javaFX for my second semester subject: Software development in practice
## üéÆ How to Play
There are 22 red, and 3 blue pieces on the 5x5 sized controller. One player moves with red, the other, with blue. The blue player begins the game.
Every step consists of moving one piece.

- **Movements**:
  - The **Red Player** can only move to a neighbouring field.
  - The **Blue Player** can only move to a neighbouring field that is already occupied by a red piece. Then, this red piece will be removed.

- **Winning Conditions**:
  - The **Red Player** wins if all **Blue Pieces** are aligned in the same row or column.
  - The **Blue Player** wins if no more valid moves are possible for the Blue pieces.
